            <p>Wire-Tapping (Elecronics) game was one of four mini-games, which made up bulk of the gameplay of the
                classic Microprose / Sid Meier game "Covert Action", released in 1990.</p>
            <p>For more info about original Sid Meier's Covert Action game visit <a

            <p>The Electronics Mini-Game is a logic puzzle. In the game, a view of a circuit board shows electricity
                flowing through a large set of Elrctronic Chips which can allow it to flow through, change its
                direction, or cut it completely. Each chip has a different effect.</p>
            <div id='Circuit_Board_img'>
                <img src="Assets/Circuit Board.png" alt="Circuit Board" style="height: 100%;">
                <p>When doing electronics work, the screen shows a close-up of a circuit board. It is covered with
                    chips, and there are signal traces running across the board and through those chips.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The game is based on the ability to logically determine which wire goes where, and decide which
                Electronic Chip should be installed at each position on the circuit board in order to let electricity
                flow to the right places and not flow to the wrong places.</p>
            <p>From the Player's point-of-view, the Electronics Mini-Game requires good logic skills, and being able to
                quickly analyze the logical pattern on the circuit board.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_2">
            <header>Objectives and Rules</header>
            <p>The Electronics game begins with the chips on the board arranged in a way that the wires on the
                right-hand side (those going into the Target Chips) are carrying no electricity into the Phone chips,
                and no electricity into the Alarm chips.</p>
            <p>The Player's task is to alter the board so that the Paths running into the Phone chips will carry
                electricity. However, the game is instantly "lost" if electricity is ever passed into the Alarm chips.
            </p>
            <p>The game is played by picking up Chips from the bottom of circuit board, and placing them elsewhere to
                change the flow of electricity. Initially the player has one random "spare" chip in his hand, which he
                can replace with any other chip on the board. The chip that was picked up can then be placed elsewhere,
                and so on until the game is either won or lost.</p>
            <p>Difficulty is primarily reflected in the types of Logic Chips that can appear during the Mini-Game. On
                the easy difficulty levels, only the basic 6 chips on the table will appear. They are the simplest chips
                to work with, as they perform relatively straight-forward logical operations. The higher the difficulty
                of the Mini-Game, the more varied selection of Logic Chips will be placed on the circuit board. This
                makes it more difficult to understand what's happening to the Electricity as it makes its way towards
                the Target Chips.</p>
            <p>In addition, this game is limited in time - you only have anywhere from 6 to 12 minutes to complete the
                mini-game, otherwise it ends with a semi-failure.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_3">
            <header>Signal Paths</header>
            <p>Twisting and weaving their way across the board are 10 "Signal Paths". These are essentially like wires,
                which conduct electricity from one side of the board to the other.</p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <img src="Assets/5VandGND.png" alt="5V and GND" style="height: 100%;">
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; margin: auto;">All Paths originate in two connector points near the
                    bottom-left corner of the screen. These are marked with the letters "+5V." and "GND." One path
                    originates from each connector.<br>The Paths coming out of the "GND" connector are colored green.
                    This indicates that they are not carrying any electricity. <br>The red-and-white paths are coming
                    out of the "+5V" connector, and are thus carrying electricity.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Immediately once they come out of these connectors, each of these two Paths splits into 5 paths, giving
                us the total 10 Paths that run across the board.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_4">
            <header>Target Chips</header>
            <p>On the right-most side of the board are the 10 Target Chips. This is where all the Paths reach once
                they've made their journey across the board. Each Path ends in one Target Chip.</p>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <img src="Assets/Alarm Chip.png" alt="Alarm Chip" style="height: 100%; padding-right: 5px;">
                <img src="Assets/Phone chip.png" alt="Phone Chip" style="height: 100%;">
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; margin: auto;">Exit chips are marked with a symbol to let you know their
                    purpose. Chips leading to the Alarm are marked with a bell. Chips marked with a phone icon generates
                    victory points = "clues" once electricity is passed into them.</p>
            </div>
            <p>When the game begins, the board is configured in such a way that the Alarm Chips and Phone Chips are
                "deactivated" - the Paths running into them are green, meaning they carry no electric current.</p>
            <p>As long as Alarm Chips stays that way, the Alarm won't be triggered.</p>
            <p>Your goal is to connect the electricity reaching all Phone chips by turning those Paths red, signifying
                that the phones are all connected properly.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Section_5">
            <header>Logic Chips</header>
            <p>On the main part of the board is a set of 35 Logic Chips. These are arranged in 5 rows of 7 chips each.
                They straddle the Paths so that each Logic Ship has two Paths passing through it from left to right, one
                "Top Path" and one "Bottom Path".</p>
            <p>Each Logic Chip is also marked with a symbol. The symbol indicates the "logical operation" performed by
                that chip: It takes input from both paths on the left, processes it in some way, and puts out
                electricity on the right paths as appropriate. In other words, the chip decides which of the two paths
                exiting out its right side will carry electricity, if at all, based on what's coming in on its left.</p>
            <p>There are exactly 12 different kinds of Logic Chips that can appear on a circuit board. Each chip
                performs a different "logical operation". It acts based on the state of the two wires coming in its left
                side, producing (or withholding) electricity on the two wires coming out the right side. To determine
                what logical operation is performed by any Logic Chip, it is necessary to identify the symbol emblazoned
                on that chip. These symbols are often self-explanatory, and can easily be identified.</p>
            <h3>Stuck Chips</h3>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <img src="Assets/Stuck Chip.png" alt="Stuck Chip" style="height: 100%;">

                <p style="padding-left: 20px; margin: auto;">Regardless of the current Mini-Game Difficulty, the 5
                    right-most Logic Chips on the circuit board cannot be moved. They are called "Stuck Chips", and are
                    surrounded by a thick grey border to distinguish them from all the other Logic Chips.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A Player cannot pick up Stuck Chips, nor can he place any other chips in their stead. He will just need
                to take them into account and work around them.</p>
            <p>On higher difficulty levels, there are more Stuck Chips scattered across the board, making the mini-game
                more complicated.</p>
            <h3>Unknown Chips</h3>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">
                <img src="Assets/Unknown Chip.png" alt="Unknown Chip" style="height: 100%;">
                <p style="padding-left: 20px; margin: auto;">On the higher mini-game difficulties, some chips may
                    initially be "Unknown". They appear without any symbol emblazoned on them. A Player can try to
                    figure out what each of these Unknown Chips do by observing the way electricity flows through them -
                    I.E. looking at the state of the Input and Output wires and trying to deduce what type of operation
                    is performed on the shown input to get the shown output.</p>
            </div>
            <p>If Player ever places down a Logic Chip to replace an Unknown Chip, the Unknown Chip is then revealed,
                showing the correct symbol emblazoned on it for the remainder of the Mini-Game.</p>
            <p>This is very important. If you don't know what a chip is doing, you can't anticipate what will happen
                once you change the input that chip gets. Knowing what kind of chip it is allows you to figure out
                what'll happen say, if you cut electricity to one of its Input Wires. Once the chip's symbol is
                revealed, this becomes much easier to figure out.</p>
            <p>One very important trick to learn with regards to Unknown Chips is being able to replace them without
                changing the board at all. In other words, placing another chip in their stead (which automatically
                reveals their symbol, as explained above) without causing any unexpected (and dangerous) change to the
                flow of electricity.</p>
            <p>This is why each of the individual Logic Chip pages lists the types of chips that can be substituted for
                one another without changing the output at all. Learning how to do this will make the harder difficulty
                levels significantly easier.</p>
